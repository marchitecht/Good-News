# Good-News

the Client requested to create the MVP for a web news agency. So as a result we've developed several features the Client wanted to embed into the web-site.


1. Creating tags for the particular search query;

2. Filtering by tags;

3. Search by tags.

The client provided with us with an API to fetch news blocks. As a result we designed a db that can filter news depending on queries. Hence the client can manually sort the news.
